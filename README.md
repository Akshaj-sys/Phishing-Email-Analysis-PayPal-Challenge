# Phishing-Email-Analysis-PayPal-Challenge

This repository contains a practical exercise conducted on LetsDefend.io's **Phishing Email Challenge**, where I successfully completed all tasks and earned the **Phishing Analyzer badge**.  

The challenge involved analyzing a suspicious PayPal email, identifying phishing indicators, validating the threat using VirusTotal, and confirming whether it was a phishing email.

## Tools Used

The exercise covered:
1. Examining email headers to find the return path.
2. Identifying suspicious domains in the email body.
3. Checking the domain against VirusTotal for malicious activity.
4. Retrieving the SHA-256 hash of the email body.
5. Concluding whether the email was phishing based on gathered evidence.

## Key Learning Points

- Hover over links to find hidden or misleading domains.
- Not all security vendors flag phishing links — context matters.
- SHA-256 hashes are useful for validating email content integrity.
- Practical workflow simulates real-world phishing analysis.
